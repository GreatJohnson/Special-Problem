accuracy on cifar-10 : 93.4%

What have I done:
Since the TA said that we are able to use some pre-trained models, so I use a VGG-13 network to do this task. 
But I dont have enough training computer sourses at this moment, so I get some pre-trained parametres of VGG-13 model and used this pt parameters in this task.
The result turns out to be good. And since the pt file is too large, I cannot upload it in gradscope.
